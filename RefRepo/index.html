	<h2>Readings</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://franklloydwright.org/lesson-frank-lloyd-wright-patterns-nature/">A Lesson from Frank Lloyd Wright: Patterns of Nature</a></li>
			<ul><li>"Let us learn to see within, at least far enough to grasp essential pattern in all created things. Method in creation will come freely to him who learns to see in the abstract. Study the geometry that is the idea of every form: a quail, a snail, a shell, a fish. Take for analysis the more simple, obvious things first."</li></ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Computational-Organicism%3A-Examining-Evolutionary-in-Holland/bda055b336e8acbd1a8d4dd7e727adf7fd895129">Computational Organicism: Examining Evolutionary Design Strategies in Architecture</a></li>
			<ul><li>"Today the debasement of geological forms as “unorganized” is clearly disputed by current scientific theories of self-organization and emergence, which ascribe to matter the inherent generative capacity for spontaneous development of complex order."</li></ul>
