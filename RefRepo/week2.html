	<h2>Readings</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Posthuman Spiritualities in Contemporary Performce: Politics, Ecologies, and Perceptions by Silvia Battista</li>
			<ul>
				<li>"Ordinary human beings do nont like mystery since you cannot put a bridle on it, and therefore, in general they exclude it, they repress it, they elimminate it - and it's settled. But if on the contrary one remains open and susceptible to all the phenomena of overflowing, beginning with natural phenomena, one discovers the immense landscape of the trans-, of the passage (Cixous 1997:51-2)" - p. vii</li>
				<li>"As an epistemology, performance offers: a rediscovery of the now, relocation in the here; return to the primacy o experience, of the event; rediscovery that the facts are relatikons, that all knowledge exists on the threshold and in the interaction between subject and object (which are themselves only hypostatisations); a rediscover of ambiguity, of contradiction, of difference; a sassertion that things - and people are what they do..." - David George p. viii</li>
				<li>"When space, time, self are conceived as a 'multiple foldable diversity' (Serres and Laour 1995: 59), a field of flows and intensities - spacing, tinming, selfing - then perhaps a dynamically porous self-in-process and in-relation can fray just a little the dualist territorial imaginaries of 'inside' and outside', of self-identity in binary opposition to radical alterity. If one can accept the paradox that the coninutiy of identity is secured through movement and the capacity to change rather than the ability to cling on to what is already established, [...] then one's responsibility is to abandon the logics of mastery, to 'look again' and listen otherwise, and let untimely, numinous elements of all sorts of 'outsides' in-here. In this way, identity can become 'a point of dparture for a vooyage without guarantees, and not a port of arrival' (Chambers 2001:25), and 'home' (oikos, the eco-, and the self itself) can be considered no longer as a 'fixed structure', but as 'a contingent passaage, a way that literally carries [one] elsewhere'." - p. xi</li>
				<li>"Art is therefore viewed as 'a vehicle' for involving spectators/participants in levels of experience that touch on that likminal space between discovery, experience, creativty and imagination, revealing the performance of those invisible, intangible human and non-human ' others' which are usually excluded from our perceptive fields. These 'others' emerge and enter the perceptive horizon  due to a change of practices that by irrupting and disrupting perception, reveal the paradoxical numinosity of reality." - p. 3</li>
				<li>The so called 'post-modern self' is, in fact, wihtout a fixed identity, being fragmented and in flux, entagled in an endless process of self-creation by new tchnological transformations, multiple online identities, consumer lifestyles, and global population movements that construct and deconstruct, on a daily basis, its own sense of identity." - p. 11 </li>
				<li>Performance is therefore suggested as the locus for experimenting with technologies of the self and types of experiences in intropspection, and in ways that are different from both the dominant scientifi model and the religious creeds from which the practices of inspiration originated." - p.15</li>
				<li>The theologians Rudolf Otto, in his phenomenological analysis of the religious experience, describes this breach of ordinary perception as the encourage with the numen praesense, the 'whole other', an object whose nature, trascending the known, breaks the boundaries of the conceivable and provokes in the individual or collective encountering it, unique types of emotions. Otto described this in paradoxical terms by employing the Latine mysterium tremendum and mysterium fascinans to characterize the numninous experience as a feeling-response bringing and holding together contrasting inner responses such as terror and ecstasy. The mysterium tremendum is depicted by Otto wiht dramatic emphasis, for exmple, as the 'awe-aweful' akin to 'religious dread', the horror of Pan 'with its queer perversion', the reaction to 'somthing uncanny', the weird, or the 'tremor, elicited by the encounter with what is regarded as unfamiliar or 'wholly other'. On the contrary, the mysterium fascinans is portrayed as the 'absolute fascination' that William James describes as the 'effect of some great orchestra, when all the separate notes have melted into one swelling harmony', the bliss, 'the wonderfulness', 'the rapture and the over-abounding'. feelings experienced by participating in something that lies beyond the singular and that the singular cannont fully possess. The two feelings described above coexist in Otto's conception of the religious experience and contribute to his illustration of a gentle tide that: 'may burst in sudden reuption up from the depths of the soul (...) [or] lead to the strangest excitements, to intoxicating frenzy, to transpoort, and to ecstasy. It may (also) become the hushed, trembling, and speechless humility of the creattive in the presence of - whom or what? In the presence of that which is a mystery inexpressible.' - p.17</li>

			<ul>
				<li>"The design of your product is only as good as its smallest part." - p. 6</li>
				<li>"In competitive markets, microinteractions are even more important. When there is feature parity, it is the experience using the product that increases adoption and brand loyalty." - p. 7</li>
				<li>"Well-design microinteractions can scale well across platforms and to millions of users" - p. 8</li>
				<li>"As DeRouchey says in "The History of the Button", 'The button meant of the first time the result of the human motion could be completely different from the motion [it creates] itself.' Action became abstract." - p. 12</li>
				<li>Structure of a microinteraction</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Trigger - initiates the MI</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Understanding user need: objective, timing, frequency --> determines affordances, accessbility, and persistence of the trigger</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Rules - how the MI works</li>
					<li>Feedback - illuminates the rules</li>
					<ul>
						<li>visual, aural, haptic (vibrations), animations</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Loops and Modes - way to design and dissect the microinteraction</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What happens to the MI over time?</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>
					3 ways to incorporate MI into products
					<ol>
						<ul>Case-by-case
							<li>Make a list of all MI</li>
							<li>Signature Moments: product differentiating MI --> creates customer loyalty and brand recognition</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>Reduce complex apps into individual products built around one MI
							<li>MI as product with 1 job, reduced to its essence (e.g. Instagram)</li>
							<li>Radical simplicity</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>Complex digital products comprised of many MI
							<li>Details working in harmony to create the whole</li>
						</ul>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Input methods
					<ul>
						<li>Physical: buttons, switches, keyboard, mouse</li>
						<li>Touchscreens, senseors, voice, gesutral </li>
					</ul>

					<li>"A designed experience flows lilke a river, pausing and at times rushing forwards, but always with rhythm and guiding purpose."</li>
					<li>Create a High Concept
						<ul>
							<li>Create engagement, excitement, and curiosity for users</li>
							<li>Empowers users to co-create/contribute to the experience</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						5Es - Touchpoints
						<ul>
							<li>Excitement - awareness and attraction to the experience</li>
							<li>Entry - crossing into one context to another</li>
							<li>Engagement - keeping user attention</li>
							<li>Exit - clear end of experience</li>
							<li>Extension - takeaway for user</li>
