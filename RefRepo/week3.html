	<div class="section">
		<h2>Questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What are the defining characteristics of St. Louis's visual heritage?</li>
			<li>How can we bring small town America bring them into modern times without erasing its culture or displacing native residents?</li>
			<li>What are young people looking for in places to live? why would they move to  a small town in the midwest? </li>
			<li>What are some ways to fundraise in Sam Fox through leveraging our creative skills by creating high value items from low cost and sustainable materials?</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
	<h2>Thoughts + Observations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>There is a lack of programming around Sam Fox for Parent's Weekend. APX wants to create a community event that displays student work and generates conversation around Sam Fox's creative output.</li>
			<li>Urban development through bringing in a major industry can be more detrimental than helpful because it is likely for the industry to relocate to cheaper labor markets, leaving small towns and areas of development scarred in the process.</li>
			<li>The Wainwright building was influential in shaping St. Louis's visual heritage. Because of it, many other buildings in the city reference Louis Sullivan's use of exterior ornamentation. </li>
			<li>St. Louis architecture and typography seems heavily influenced by classical reference through use of columns and Trajan-esque typefaces.</li>
